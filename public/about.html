<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Giovanna, a 28-year-old aspiring web developer transitioning from a career in law to the dynamic world of web development. After several years in the legal field, I discovered a profound interest in coding and web technologies. This interest blossomed into a passion, leading me to pursue web development full-time. While my background in law might seem unrelated, it has equipped me with critical skills such as logical reasoning, research, and an ability to quickly adapt to new challengesâ€”skills that are incredibly valuable in the tech world.</p>
